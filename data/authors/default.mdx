ZhiYong Zhang, I graduated from Shanghai Ocean University and currently work as a Full Stack Developer. With expertise in Java, Node.js, Next.js, JavaScript, and more, I lead a team responsible for the frontend development of automotive e-commerce products. Together, we have successfully completed frontend infrastructure projects, including workflow optimization, rapid development, CI/CD implementation, and reliability monitoring.

Throughout my career, I have accumulated extensive experience in project management, problem-solving, and collaboration. I thrive on challenges and constantly seek to improve my skills and knowledge. With a proactive attitude and strong communication skills, I effectively coordinate with team members and other departments to drive project progress and success.

I am passionate about exploring new technologies and approaches to deliver exceptional products and user experiences. Moving forward, I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I look forward to contributing my expertise to the success of future projects and business objectives.
